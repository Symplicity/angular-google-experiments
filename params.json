Currently I'm using a timeout that assumes\r\nthe javascript instantly loads (Google's servers are pretty quick) to\r\nset the variation.\r\n\r\nIf the variation is null, either your experiment ID is incorrect, or\r\nyou have to increase the timeout because the script is taking longer\r\nto load.\r\n\r\nI tried to fix this by using onload and onreadystate, but the only\r\nconsistent thing I found that worked was using the timeout.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
